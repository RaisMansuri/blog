      Privacy Policy
    </h2> 
    <p style="text-align:left;">
      The site administrator takes your right to privacy seriously and wants you to feel comfortable using this web site. This privacy policy deals with personal data (referred to as “data” below) that may be collected by when you use our web site, our online products, and services (“Services”). This policy does not apply to other entities that are not owned or controlled by the site administrator, nor does it apply to persons that are not employees or agents of the site administrator, or that are not under the site administrator’s control. Please take time to read this site’s Terms of use.
    </p>
    <h4 style="text-align:left;">
      1. Collection of data
    </h4>
    <p style="text-align:left;">
      We collect information when you create an account, participate in any interactive features of the Services, fill out a form, register for an event, make a purchase, apply for a job, request for customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your name, email address, phone number, payment information, information about your company and current position, employment history, and any other information you choose to provide. However, registration for an account on this site requires only two mandatory details, a valid e-mail address and in some cases, the user name.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align:left;">
      You are not required to provide any other information if you do not want to. Please be aware that the user name you choose, the e- mail address you provide, and any other information you enter may render you personally identifiable, and may possibly be displayed on this web site intentionally (depending on choices you make during the registration process, or depending on the way in which the site is configured) or unintentionally (subsequent to a successful act of intrusion by a third party). As on many web sites, the site administrator may also automatically receive general information that is contained in server log files, such as your IP address, and cookie information.
    </p>
